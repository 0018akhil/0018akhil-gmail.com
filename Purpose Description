Traffic management measures are aimed at improving the safety and flow of traffic,
reducing traffic emissions and utilising traffic artery capacity more effectively. Traffic
management is used to curb demand for transport and affect the selection of the
mode of transport, route, or the time of travel or transport. In particular, it is utilised
during the first stages of the four-step principle applied in the development of traffic
conditions.
Traffic management comprises the following elements: traffic information, traffic
control, incident management, demand management, driver support and monitoring,
and fleet and transport management. It also requires reliable, up-to-date status
information on the transport system.
Traffic information offers up-to-date information for road users, both before and
during travel. The information provided covers topics such as weather and road
conditions, road maintenance, traffic incidents, traffic situation and alternative
modes of travel.
Traffic is controlled per intersection, road section or the entire road network. Traffic
control is divided into fixed and variable traffic control.
Incident management concerns the detection, handling and elimination of traffic
incidents, such as accidents, in co-operation with various authorities.
Demand management is used to affect choices in the destination, time, mode of
transport or route of travel or transport. Means of achieving this include regulating
access or parking, arranging park-and-ride facilities, supporting carpooling,
promoting public transport and pedestrian and bicycle traffic, providing traffic
information and using peak-hour tolls and other road use charges.
Monitoring systems include automatic speed and intersection control, monitoring
transports of hazardous materials and automatic lane-use monitoring
